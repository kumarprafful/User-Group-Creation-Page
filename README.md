I approached the problem "User Group Creation Page" and solved it using ReactJS.

Instructions to run the app:-
1. Install the dependencies - `yarn` or `npm install`
2. After the dependencies are successfully install you can run the project using `yarn start` or `npm run start`

The commands will open run the project on http://localhost:3000.
I have also deployed this app on netlify. Link =  https://caavo-ui-prafful.netlify.app/
